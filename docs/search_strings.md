# Executed Search Queries and Filters

This document provides the exact executed search strings, applied filters, result counts, and visual execution logs for each database used in the systematic literature review.

All searches were executed between 10–15 January 2025.

The general protocol-level query was:

("Android" OR "Android app*") AND "Quality" AND Empirical* AND (issue* OR bug* OR defect* OR evaluat* OR assess* OR framework* OR approach* OR tool* OR model*)

Minor syntax adaptations were applied where required due to database-specific constraints (e.g., wildcard support, Boolean clause limits).
